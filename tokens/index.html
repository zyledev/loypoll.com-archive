		<h1>The Sertif Hack</h1>
		<p>In August 2020, Loypoll and another person named Denchick gained access to Sertif's Discord account, who is the co-developer of Pizza Tower, through a fake mod labelled as a "Wario Land 4 Music Mod".
		</br>The .exe file inside was actually a token stealer (A program that as it's name suggests, steals a Discord users account token and sends it to the attacker.), allowing them to log into the account with no permission.
		</br>When they got into the account, they managed to access the staff channels of the now closed Pizza Tower Discord, taking roughly a Gigabyte of Pizza Tower development files taken from Discord attachments and Dropbox links up to May 28th, 2020.</p>
		<h3>Now because of this hack, two major leaks in the community happened.</h3>
		<p>The first leak occurred on August 15th, 2020 when a compressed archive titled ptleak.7z was uploaded to 4chan within a Mega link.
		</br>The archive contained the Game Maker 2 Studio project file to Western Build v3 and a small portion of Discord attachments, which consisted of unreleased and work-in-progress music.
		</br>The second leak occured on August 22th, 2020 when the full Dropbox URL to the Game Maker 2 Studio project file was included in a 4chan post, as well all Discord attachments in a compressed archive titled not so staff only anymore is it lads.rar.
		</br>This archive contains master versions of the soundtrack up to that point, unreleased music, work-in-progress music, a few sound effects, and a demo for potential singers for Pizza Mayhem, which was already public to everyone wanting to submit their takes. 
		</br>Loypoll and Denchick eventually lost access to Sertif's account through, because Denchick typed in a single "n" letter and accidentally sent it in the general chat. Sertif quickly took notice and changed his password, kicking them off his account.</p>
		<h3>However, the damage had already been done.</h3>

		<h1>The Aftermath of the Hack</h1>
		<p>The biggest thing that happened is the creation of the mod "Pizza Tower: Online" (made by Loypoll of course), being completely based on the stolen source code.
		</br>This mod has had quite a bit against it, as well as it eventually becoming the drama-filled "Cheesed Up!"
		</br>The other thing was as you'd expect, hurting the devs as all their work up to that point had been leaked, including code, music and assets.</p>
