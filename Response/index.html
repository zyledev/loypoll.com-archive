		<h1></h1>
		<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/zoeBYQxaHoI?si=kkxizgbKEldSAicA">Loypoll's new video</a> responding to uhyeah, we have realized that he has a new method of deflecting backlash.
		</br>at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zoeBYQxaHoI&t=294s">4:54</a> he states "but they dont include the fact that <strong>it was targeted</strong>. They dont include the that it only triggered for people that were doxxing me."
		</br>Now, Loypoll, I'd love to hear how each and every person on that list was doxxing you. RadixComet's ex girlfriend? Disttraction? Absnormal? kenan238? meliadev? nailsrails? Zyle? I know for a fact that way over half of that list has not even tried to doxx you. You just dont like them.</p>
		<h3>You want to gain leverage by threatening them with their information.</h3>
		<p>I'd love to be proven wrong on this but havent you changed your defense multiple times now? You just dont seem to quit.  Lets go through the amount of times that you changed your defense, shall we?
		</br><h3>"Cheesed up doesn't have an ip logger"</h3>
		</br><img src="img/yeahitdoes.png">
		</br>Im sorry loy but these are 2 contradicting statements does it have an IP logger or not? Thats not even MENTIONING how youre downplaying it by saying that online mods use your IP for connection.  Online mods dont log your PC name and discord tag to specify who it is.
		</br>Whats obviously happening here is that you are attempting to downplay the IP logger by showing mods that have online functionality (which cheesed up doesnt currently and didnt at the time of the IP logger) to downplay that you have added malware to your pizza tower mod.</p>

		<h3>Juicy ham and leakers</h3>
		<img src="img/andleakers.png">
		<p>Now im unable to find the original, BUT I <italic>was</italic> able to find a discordchatexporter file with it.
		</br>You can view the exported chats from this from <a href="https://mega.nz/file/djVBWQoJ#1C470B4r7EhDPu2PeHuVBYrktyZ_VjIlMrv_UY9cs6U">here</a>
		</br>Now I dont think I have to explain everything here but this is a bit contradicting for loypoll, they were leakers, now theyre doxxers? this example shows that loypoll constantly pulls shit out of his ass to get his way.</p>

	<div class=headerbox>
		<h3>everything that connects has to have your IP</h3>
		<video width="640" height="480" controls><source src="img/yes.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video><br>
		<p>This is true, but <strong>Pizza Tower: Cheesed Up didnt have any online functionality</strong> and at the time of writing this <strong>still doesnt.</strong>
		</br>This is another strong example of loypoll's manipulation, this is obviously an attempt to make people believe that the IP logger wasnt as bad as it seems.
		</br>People dont like loypoll for a reason.</p>
